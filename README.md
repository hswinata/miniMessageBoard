# miniMessageBoard

This project was developed during my full-stack engineer bootcamp, emphasizing fundamental web development skills. It represents a pivotal stage in my learning process, demonstrating my ability to create a web application with a robust backend infrastructure, seamless database integration, and a well-organized Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

## Features
1. Backend Server Setup:
  - Utilizing Express.js, the project establishes a stable backend server to handle HTTP requests and responses effectively.
2. Database Integration:
  - The application seamlessly connects to a PostgreSQL database using the node-postgres library, showcasing my proficiency in database management.
3. View Engine Implementation:
  - Pug (formerly known as Jade) is employed as the view engine, providing a structured and dynamic presentation layer for the web application.
4. MVC Architectural Pattern:
  - The project adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase that separates concerns appropriately.

## Technologies:
1. Backend Framework: Express.js
2. Database: PostgreSQL
3. View Engine: Pug (Jade)
4. Project Skeleton Generator: express-generator
